#### Hide Actor
Hide the actor  
<img src="/img/events/actor-hide-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Hide All Sprites
Hide all sprites in scene.

Can be useful to create cutscenes where the player should not be visible by adding to a scene's starting script.  
<img src="/img/events/sprites-hide-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### If Actor At Position
Conditionally execute part of the script if the specified actor is at a certain position in the scene.  
<img src="/img/events/if-actor-at-position-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

<img src="/img/events/display-dialogue-v3.png" class="event-preview" />
<img src="/img/events/display-dialogue-preview.png" class="event-preview" />
<br />

- Using the _+_ button you can create a dialogue sequence which will only close after the last message has been displayed.  
- You can display the numerical value of any variables in a text box by typing `$` followed by the name of the variable and selecting the variable from the drop down list that appears.
- You can change the font used in a text field dynamically by typing `!f` and selecting from the menu.
- You can change the text speed dynamically by typing `!s` and selecting from the menu.
- You can optionally display an avatar image on the left hand side of the dialogue box by clicking _Add Avatar_ and selecting an image to use. 
  
  Avatars are created as `16px` x `16px` `.png` images in the `/assets/avatars` folder. See the [UI Elements](/docs/ui-elements/#avatars) documentation for my information.  

#### Display Menu
Display a menu of multiple options and set the specified variable to the value of the chosen option. 
Multiple layouts are provided, `Menu` (shown below) displays as a single column on the right hand side of the game screen and `Dialogue` displays a full width dialogue box with two columns. You can optionally set the `B` button to close the menu setting the variable to `0` and can also make the last menu item return `0` when selected.

<img src="/img/events/variable-math-v3.png" class="event-preview" />


## Music and Sound Effects

#### Play Music Track
Plays a music .mod file, optionally looping the file when finished. If you play a new song while another song is playing, the old song will stop automatically.  
<img src="/img/events/music-play-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Play Sound Effect
Play a sound effect, choose from playing a beep with a given pitch, a tone with a given frequency or cymbal crash. Using [Custom Scripts](/docs/custom-scripts) you can combine multiple effects into a single reusable event to make jingles.  
<img src="/img/events/sound-effect-play-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Stop Music

## Scene

#### Change Scene
Transition to a new scene with player at a specified position and direction. A connection line will be drawn between the source of the event and the destination scene with a <img src="/img/screenshots/destination-end.png" style="height:12px"/> icon appearing at the destination position. It's possible to drag this icon around and between scenes to modify the event.  
<img src="/img/events/scene-change-v3.png" class="event-preview" /><img src="/img/events/switch-scene-preview.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Store Current On Scene Stack
Store the current scene and player state on to the scene stack, this allows you to return to this exact location later using the _Scene Restore_ events. A common use of this event would be to include in a script just before a _Change Scene_ event to open a menu scene, in the menu scene you could wait for the player to press a close button and then use the _Restore Previous From Stack_ event to return to where the player opened the menu.  
<img src="/img/events/scene-stack-push-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Restore Previous From Scene Stack
Transition to the last stored scene from the scene stack using the specified fade speed. The previous scene will then be removed from the stack so the next time this event is used it will transition to the scene before that.  
<img src="/img/events/scene-stack-pop-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Restore First From Scene Stack
Transition to the very first scene stored on the stack, for instance if you had multiple levels of menu scenes you could use this to imediately return to the game scene. This event will cause the scene stack to become empty.  
<img src="/img/events/scene-stack-pop-all-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Remove All From Scene Stack
Remove all scenes from the scene stack without leaving the current scene.  
<img src="/img/events/scene-stack-clear-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

<img src="/img/events/overlay-show-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Overlay Move To
Moves the overlay to a new position on the screen.  
<img src="/img/events/overlay-move-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Hide Overlay
Hides the screen overlay.  
<img src="/img/events/overlay-hide-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

Pause script for up to 10 seconds.  
<img src="/img/events/wait-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Attach Timer Script
Execute the specified script repeatedly after a time interval. The script will keep running in the background until a _Remove Timer Script_ event is called or the scene is changed using a _Change Scene_ event.
<img src="/img/events/timer-start-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Restart Timer
Reset the countdown timer back to zero. The script will call again after the time specified originally.  
<img src="/img/events/timer-restart-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

#### Remove Timer Script
Remove the timer script so it will no longer be called.  
<img src="/img/events/timer-remove-v3.png" class="event-preview" />


## Variables

Your game has 512 variables that can be shared across all the scripts in your game. Additionally every _Actor_, _Trigger_ and _Scene_ has 6 local variables that can only be accessed by that specific entity. Local variables are useful for keeping track of state specific to an entity such as how many times you have spoken to a character or if a treasure chest is open or closed.

#### Evaluate Math Expression

Store the result of a math expression in a variable.  
<img src="/img/events/expression-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

<img src="/img/events/variable-reset-v3.png" class="event-preview" />

## Miscellaneous

#### Comment
Allows you to leave notes within your scripts. Provides no functionality in-game. The text you type automatically gets set in the event title, so you can collapse the comment and still read its content.
<img src="/img/events/comment.png" class="event-preview" />  
You can also use the event dropdown menu to disable and reenable any event.  
Disabled events will be skipped when run in game.  
<img src="/img/events/event-disable-menu.png" class="event-preview" />
<img src="/img/events/event-disabled.png" class="event-preview" />
