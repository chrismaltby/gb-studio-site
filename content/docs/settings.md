Clicking the _Project Navigator_ and selecting _Settings_ will take you to a list of your project's settings.

## GB Color Options

GB Studio has some limited support for GB Color when your game is run on compatible hardware or emulators. There are two options currently available:

- **Use Double Speed Mode** - When enabled allows the game engine to make full use of the GB Color's increased CPU speed. Enabling this option helps prevent music skipping when transitioning between scenes.

- **Use Custom Color Palette** - When enabled allows the four colors in your game's color palette to be replaced. Click on the color you wish to replace then choose the red, green and blue values to use or enter a hex color value and click _Convert Hex_ to match the closest available color.

Using a custom color palette you can create a drastically different tone for your game! Try experimenting to see what you can come up with. If you don't like your color palette you can always click _Restore Default_ to the get the original palette back again.

## Controls

The _Controls_ section allows you to override the default controls used when playing your game from a Web build and the _Play Window_.

To edit the controls for a button click on the input box and while the input is highlighted type the key you wish to assign. To remove all the assigned keys click the input and then press the _Backspace_ key on your keyboard.

To reset to the original controls you can use the _Restore Default_ button.

## Cartridge Type

The _Cartridge Type_ section allows you to choose which Memory Bank Controller you want to use and if a battery will be included when exporting your game to a physical cartridge (requires additional hardware and software).

If you don't know what these settings mean it's best to keep this as the default of MBC5+RAM+BATTERY which you can do by using the _Restore Default_ button.
