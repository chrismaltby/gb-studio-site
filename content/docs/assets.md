When your project was created an `assets` folder was also made within the project containing a number of subfolders for each asset type in your game.

GBStudio doesn't currently contain any ability to edit the graphics in your game directly, you instead can use your favourite existing applications and save files into these folders where they will instantly appear ready to use in your project. If you edit a sprite or background PNG file and save using an external image editor the change will be seen in your _Project Window_ as soon as you switch back to it.

While you can create graphics in any application that can output PNG files it is recommended to use [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) or Photoshop to create your sprites and UI elements then to use [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to create your backgrounds. Each image asset type has a different set of requirements detailed over the new few sections of this documentation. You can select the default application to open when clicking asset edit buttons in the _GB Studio Preferences_ window.

For music you can either create UGE files or MOD files depending on the _Music Driver_ you choose in the _Settings View_ (hUGEDriver is recommended).
- UGE files can be edited directly within the GB Studio [Music Editor](/docs/music).
- MOD files can be edited with [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org/) or [MilkyTracker](https://milkytracker.titandemo.org/).

## Community Assets

If you're looking for a collection of free assets, ready to be used in GB Studio there is a community run repository on Github available at [GB Studio Community Assets](https://github.com/DeerTears/GB-Studio-Community-Assets).
