Triggers are areas in a scene that, when the player walks over them, will cause a script to play. They are useful for creating doorways between scenes and to start cutscenes when the player moves to a specific position.

## Adding a Trigger

To add a trigger to a scene click the _**+** button_ button in the _Editor Tools_ and select _Trigger_ from the menu (alternatively press the **T** key), then click and drag across the scene where you wish to place the trigger setting the desired width and height.

The _Editor Sidebar_ will switch to show the trigger settings where you can give the trigger a name for easier navigation later, reposition and scale the trigger and create the script that will play when the player walks on the trigger.

## Scripting

When the trigger is selected click the _Add Event button_ in the _Editor Sidebar_ to open the event menu and start building the script. For more information see the documentation for [Scripting](/docs/scripting).
