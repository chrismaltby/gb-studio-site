Sound effects can be added to your game using the [Sound: Play Effect](/docs/scripting#sound-events) event in your _Actor_, _Trigger_ or _Scene_ scripts.

You can choose from playing a beep with a given pitch, a tone with a given frequency or cymbal crash.

Using [Custom Events](/docs/custom-events) you can combine multiple effects into a single reusable event to make jingles.
