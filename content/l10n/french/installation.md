Download your preferred version from the [Itch.io download page](https://chrismaltby.itch.io/gb-studio) or the [older releases page](/downloads/older-versions).

## Windows

Two versions of GB Studio are available for Windows. The _Squirrel Installer_ version just requires you to unzip, double click and then wait a few seconds while the application installs to your C:\ drive. Once installed a shortcut will be added to your desktop automatically and the application will start. The application will be installed to `%LocalAppData%\gb_studio`, if you need to install to a different location use the _Manual_ version.

The _Manual_ version is a zip containing the application files, you can unzip this to any location. Once unzipped double click `gb-studio.exe` to start.

## macOS

For macOS unzip the downloaded file and move `GB Studio.app` to your _Applications_ folder. Double click to start.

If you're having trouble building or running your game you may also need to install Apple's Command Line Tools by opening `Applications/Terminal.app` and entering the following command.

```
xcode-select --install
```

> gb-studio
```

## Fedora / RPM-based Linux
